    "# 5DGAI - Gemini Student Services Agent with Model Context Protocol Tooling\n",
    "\n",
    "Author: Eidan J. Rosado\n",
    "\n",
    "GitHub and HuggingFace Handle: `EdyVision`\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook was created as part of the Google Gemini + Kaggle 2025 5-day training. It leverages a HuggingFace-hosted MCP server to provide tooling for Gemini to provide rich registrar and financial aid chat interactions and summarizations. Towards the end of the project, a custom Agent is built to combine functionality into 1 seamless call and the agent's response is eventually evaluated by a Gemini AI response evaluator.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Case\n",
    "For my use case, I went with the standard case for many students at a college or university, the student services portal! I wanted to be able to interact with Gemini using context from student profiles and the financial aid records. When pulling the student profiles, I wanted it to maintain their course history, program details, GPA, etc. The following is a sample fictitious record for a student:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"student_id\": \"5dbeccea-947a-4817-b3cb-2c9231bac4f5\",\n",
    "    \"name\": \"Valerie Gray\",\n",
    "    \"courses\": \"[\\\"PSY110\\\", \\\"ENG202\\\", \\\"PHIL101\\\", \\\"CHEM121\\\"]\",\n",
    "    \"is_need_based_qualified\": true,\n",

    "    \"gpa\": 3.27\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "I wanted to focus on just one thing in my interactions with Gemini…\n",
    "\n",
    "```What financial aid options does a student qualify for?```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Capabilities Demonstrated\n",
    "- Structured Output via JSON config ✅\n",
    "- Few-shot prompting ✅\n",
    "- Function Calling with Gemini tool use ✅\n",
    "- Gemini Agent Definition and use ✅\n",
    "- AI Evaluation ✅\n",

    "\n",
    "## Disclaimers\n",
    "<em>The dataset behind the MCP is entirely fictitious. No real student records were used. This notebook and associated MCP are both free from any conflict of interest to the best of the author's knowledge.</em>"

    "Now, I could have done a simple API and moved along, but I wanted to use this opportunity to get acquainted with building out a Model Context Protocol (MCP). This is similar to APIs, except AI Agents are able to interact with the exposed tools (think of these as function calls). So I ended up building the `student-services-demo-mcp` project to help me get this project going. I used the MCP to provide Gemini with context from fictitious data to generate the responses we are after."
